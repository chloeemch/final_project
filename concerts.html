        <img src="images/sntour.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift signing at the Speak Now Tour" class="sntour">
        <p class="snwriting">Speak Now was the first Taylor Swift concert I attended. I went when I was 8 years old, and I actually fell asleep at the end of the concert.
            Despite falling asleep, I remember how amazing and fun the concert was. The show ended with fireworks, which quickly woke me up.
        </p>
        <img src="images/1989tour.webp" alt="Taylor Swift signing at the 1989 Tour" class="ninetour">
        <p class="ninewriting"> 1989 was such a fun concert for me because I went with my entire family. I remember Shawn Mendes opened for Taylor, which was really cool. 
            This is a true pop-album, so I was dancing during the entire concert.
        </p>
        <img src="images/reptour.webp" alt="Taylor Swift signing at the Reputation Stadium Tour" class="reptour">
        <p class="repwriting"> The Reputation Stadium Tour was my favorite concert I've ever been to (before the Eras Tour). The way she remixed certain songs was so iconic, and her costumes were amazing.
            I actually saw this concert two nights in a row, and I got floor seats for the second night. I had such a great time both nights! </p>
        <img src="images/eras.webp" alt="Taylor Swift signing at the Eras Tour" class="erastour">
        <p class="eraswriting">The Eras Tour is obviously one of the biggest tours ever. This tour has broken countless records and after attending, I can see why.
            This 3-hour show was non-stop fun. This was one of the most fun nights ever!
